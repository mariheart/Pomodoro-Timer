Instructions:
On the top left, you can change the color of the background. Please press one to truly get the bubble experience since the first BG is static.
On the bottom left, you can change the color of the buttons. Please be advised as once you press a button, you won't get white again.
On the bottom right, you can 1. Customize centre reminder using the input box, or 2. Set up an alarm for a reminder. If you press start outright, you get 1 minute. If you press either of the minute timers, the timer will be reset to that time.
On the top right is the current time.

Have fun!
